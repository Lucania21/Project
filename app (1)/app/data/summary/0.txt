- Methodology for developing and evaluating an AI-powered summarization app for students.
- Preamble: Develop a web app using AI summarization to manage student workload.
- System Requirements Analysis: Identifying and analyzing app requirements.
- Stakeholder Identification and Analysis:
  - Students: Efficient workload management, understanding key concepts, task prioritization.
  - Instructors: Enhance student learning and engagement, secure material sharing.
  - Developers: Clear requirements and resource access.
- User Requirements Elicitation:
  - Techniques: User interviews, student surveys.
  - Focus: Understand current workload management practices, identify pain points and desired functionalities.
- System Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:
  - Functional: Upload materials, generate summaries, generate mini summaries and quizzes, text-to-speech, save/organize summaries, generate quizzes/flashcards, share summaries.
  - Non-Functional: Intuitive UI, efficient on various devices, fast/reliable summarization, secure user data.
- System Design: Translating requirements into a technical blueprint.
- System Architecture Overview:
  - Client-Side: User interactions, display summaries, basic data processing.
  - Server-Side: AI summarization model, data storage.
  - Communication: Secure API for data exchange.
- Data Model Design:
  - Entities: Users, Workload Materials, Summaries, Quiz.
  - Relationships: Users upload materials, materials have multiple summaries.
- User Interface Design:
  - Prioritize user experience and ease of use.
  - Clear layout, core functionalities, customization options.
- AI Model Integration Strategy:
  - Transformer-based AI summarization model via API.
  - Client-side: Pre-process uploads before server-side processing.
  - Server-side: Interaction with AI model to generate summaries, send back to client.
- Evaluation Criteria Definition: Measuring app success.
- Metrics: ROUGE score for AI performance, user satisfaction surveys, task completion time for usability.
- Evaluation Methods: User study with pre-study survey, baseline performance, app usage, post-study survey.
- Ethical and Legal Considerations: Addressing ethical and legal implications.
- Ethical Guidelines Compliance: Transparency, fairness, accountability.
- Privacy and Data Protection: Data anonymization, informed consent, secure storage.
- Conclusion: Systematic analysis of needs, design, evaluation, ethical guidelines, and data protection for creating a responsible, user-centric app.
